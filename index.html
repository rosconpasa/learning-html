        <p>"Do you know what one of the best things about Spider-Man's suit is? He was completely covered,
            so any kid could imagine they were Spider-Man... because no skin color is visible.
            He could be black underneath, he could be red, he could be yellow. He could be of any race."</p>

    <h2>Poem about <em>Spider-Man</em></h2>

    <pre style="color: brown;">
        In the heights of the city, weaving his fate,

        Spider-Man, brave hero, in the sky so divine.
        
        With webs of hope, and courage unmatched,
        
        He saves New York, his home, from every evil.
</pre>
